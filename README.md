#  three-tier Blog-11
architecture is a software architecture pattern that divides an application into three separate logical layers, each responsible for specific functionalities. 

These layers are:

**Presentation Tier (or User Interface Tier):** This tier is responsible for presenting information to the users and gathering user inputs. It typically includes user interfaces such as web browsers, mobile applications, or desktop applications. The presentation tier communicates with the other tiers to retrieve data and execute business logic.

**Application Tier (or Business Logic Tier):** Also known as the middle tier, this layer contains the business logic of the application. It processes and manipulates data, performs calculations, and implements the application's functionality. The application tier acts as an intermediary between the presentation tier and the data tier, translating user requests into operations on the data and vice versa.

**Data Tier (or Data Storage Tier):** This tier is responsible for storing and managing the application's data. It includes databases, file systems, or any other data storage mechanism. The data tier provides persistence for the application's data and is accessed by the application tier to retrieve or modify data based on user requests.

**Why ?**

The three-tier architecture separates concerns and promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability in software applications. Each tier can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for easier management and evolution of the system. Additionally, this architecture facilitates reusability of components and promotes a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain the application over time.
